Write according to the following plan:
     1. Why is this feature needed? -
         * solving the problem by writing a different design
         * a new feature that will be useful (write why?)
         * feature from To Do list
     2. Submit the feature idea to the branch "features"
What will happen next?
1. Pass all tests
2. Later your vet will be transferred to "dev" and checked manually
3. If everything is ok - we merge to the main.
4. You are cool coder!
